- Kubernetes solutions are of two types
	- Self hosted / Turn key solutions
		- You provision and configure VMs
		- Use scripts to deploy cluster

		- Ex: Kubernetes on AWS using kops or kubeone
	- Hosted / Managed solutions
		- Kubernetes as service
		- Provider provisions and maintains VMs
		- Provider installs Kubernetes
