Indian culture is a Vedic culture. Lifestyle based on Vedic culture cannot be separated from religion.

Vedic culture is a religious culture, mean a god-centered culture.

In a god-centered culture, the day begins with the remembrance of god; throughout the day, our entire life right from conception to death, everything is intimately associated with god.
- When we brush our teeth, we are supposed to pray to the gods presiding over the tree.
	- In olden days, we used twig from the tree to brush our teeth.
	- So we pray Vanaspathi devatha to remove dirt from our teeth, and also to remove the dirt from our mind.
- When we take a bath, we look upon the bath as Abhishekam done to the god within us.
- Wearing cloths is associated to the presiding deity of cloths, Revathi devatha.
- Eating is also associated with god.
- The very conception of baby happens with chanting of the Vedic mantra, so that the conceived baby will be well refined and cultured.
- Upon death, cremation is a yagna where we offer our own bidy to the homa kunda.
	- Fire is Agni devatha.

Thus, our life is a god-centered life.
